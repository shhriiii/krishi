# KrishiKendra
I developed a web project called KrishiKendra using MongoDB, RESTful API, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to address real-life problems faced by farmers. The project features images of various plant diseases, allowing farmers to visit the website and compare their plants' symptoms with the images. If a farmer finds a matching image, they can tap on it to learn more about the disease, its name, how to treat it, and the estimated costs involved. This helps educate farmers about the diseases affecting their crops and prevents them from being exploited by shopkeepers who often sell overpriced chemical solutions. Additionally, I have included a blog section that provides farmers with valuable farming tips and techniques.
